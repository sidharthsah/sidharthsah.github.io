I am a rising fifth year PhD student in Economics at the University of Chicago. I will be on the job market in 2023-24. My research is in the economics of education, with recent work on the effects of peer gender among college students. I have taught undergraduate microeconomic theory and econometrics classes.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow working for John Donohue.
