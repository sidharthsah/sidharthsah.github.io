Welcome! I am a Clinical Assistant Professor at the NYU Center for Data Science, where I teach courses in general data science, causal inference, and linear regression. My research is in the economics of education, with a particular interest in college major choice.

Prior to starting at NYU, I received a PhD in Economics from the University of Chicago.
