I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. I will be starting as a Clinical Assistant Professor at the NYU Center for Data Science in the fall. My research is in the economics of education, with recent work on the effects of peer gender among college students.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow working for John Donohue.
