I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Chicago. My research is in the economics of education, with a focus on peer effects among college students. I have taught undergraduate microeconomic theory and econometrics classes.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Stanford Law Empirical Research Fellow working for John Donohue and I earned a B.A. in Economics and Sociology from Johns Hopkins University with a minor in Mathematics.
